We type this into pug
--------------------------------
link(href='http://localhost:8080/styles.css' rel='stylesheet')


Pug turns that into this HTML
--------------------------------
<link href="http://localhost:8080/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">


We serve that HTML as part of http://localhost:3000/api/poems/a

The browser interprets that <link> tag as an instruction to fetch
a stylesheet file from a URL

The browser makes a request to http://localhost:8080/styles.css

Nginx receives a request for the route /styles.css

That route is fulfilled by our catchall block:

    location / {
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
    }

According to that block, requests to /path/to/blah should be fulfilled
by reading *from disk* the file /usr/share/nginx/html/path/to/blah

We've configured our Docker container to map from...
	/usr/share/nginx/html/path/to/blah
...to...
	$REPO/content/path/to/blah

And so, nginx fulfills the request to http://localhost:8080/styles.css
by reading from $REPO/content/styles.css
