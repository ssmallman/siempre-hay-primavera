We type this into pug
--------------------------------
link(href='/styles.css' rel='stylesheet')


Pug turns that into this HTML
--------------------------------
<link href="/styles.css" rel="stylesheet">


We serve that HTML as part of http://localhost:3000/api/poems/a

The browser interprets that <link> tag as an instruction to fetch
a stylesheet file from a URL

When the browser sees a URL like /styles.css it interprets the leading
slash as meaning "this is a relative URL"

When it needs to expand a relative URL, it takes the domain of the page
that it's currently on (i.e., the URL you see in the address bar) as a
prefix

So it turns /styles.css into http://localhost:3000/styles.css

The browser makes a request to http://localhost:3000/styles.css

Express/node receive a request for the route /styles.css

That route doesn't exist
